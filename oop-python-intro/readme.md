- Gain exposure to Python development tools

## Deck

We'll be using the deck [here](./object-oriented-programming-doc.pdf)

## Code

We'll start with the code [here](./intro-to-variables-functions.ipynb) in a Jupyter Notebook.

We'll work with Classes and Objects [here](./oop.py) using the Spyder development environment.

Example solution code from our exercise is [here](./oop-solution.py).

## Other Classes

Other classes I teach at GA are available [here](https://generalassemb.ly/instructors/joseph-nelson/9762).
