## Learning Objectives

At the end of this session, you will:
- Have a clear understanding of how APIs work, and why they are increasingly prevalent
- Know how HTTP protocol works
- Understand the basics of data types in Python
- Gain first hand experience using your very first API
- Develop an exposure to various Python development tools (Spyder, Jupyter Notebooks)

## Lesson Materials

### Introduction

**10/27 Department of Commerce workshop:** Our welcome notes and API deck is [here](https://github.com/josephofiowa/GA-DSI/blob/master/intro-to-apis-python/assets/slides/intro-to-apis-in-python-dept-of-commerce.pdf)

**10/6 workshop:** Our welcome notes and introduction to APIs deck is [here](https://github.com/josephofiowa/GA-DSI/blob/master/intro-to-apis-python/assets/slides/intro-to-apis-in-python.pdf)

### HTTP

Our discussion of how HTTP works is [here](https://github.com/josephofiowa/GA-DSI/blob/master/intro-to-apis-python/HTTP-protocol.md)

### Data Types in Python

The Jupyter Notebook we used to discuss basic data types in Python is [here](https://github.com/josephofiowa/GA-DSI/blob/master/intro-to-apis-python/code/Intro.ipynb)

### Using Our First API!

Visit the API we'll be using here: www.omdbapi.com

The .py file (that we used in Spyder) to make requests and use our very first API (gasp!) is available [here](https://github.com/josephofiowa/GA-DSI/blob/master/intro-to-apis-python/code/api-usage-example.py)

### Using Our Second API - the Department of Commerce API!

We'll now use [this](https://github.com/josephofiowa/GA-DSI/blob/master/intro-to-apis-python/code/dept-of-commerce-example.py) .py file to work with the Dept of Commerce API!

For this part of the lesson, we're going to want to use a few tools:

- Be sure to [signup for your API key](https://api.data.gov/signup/)
- This is the [documentation for the Dept of Commerce API](https://www.commerce.gov/page/api-documentation-commercegov)
- Here's a list of [government API docs](https://api.data.gov/docs/)
- We're going to want to download this [handy extension Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-formatter/bcjindcccaagfpapjjmafapmmgkkhgoa) and if you don't have Chrome, we'll use [this](http://jsonprettyprint.com/)


### Class audio


**10/6 workshop:** Our workshop audio (unfortunately no video) is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXB8NReKRrA)
