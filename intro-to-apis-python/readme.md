## Learning Objectives

At the end of this session, you will:
- Have a clear understanding of how APIs work, and why they are increasingly prevalent
- Know how HTTP protocol works
- Understand the basics of data types in Python
- Gain first hand experience using your very first API
- Develop an exposure to various Python development tools (Spyder, Jupyter Notebooks)

## Lesson Materials

### Introduction

Our welcome notes and introduction to APIs deck is [here]()

### HTTP

Our discussion of how HTTP works is [here](https://github.com/josephofiowa/GA-DSI/blob/master/intro-to-apis-python/HTTP-protocol.md)

### Data Types in Python

The Jupyter Notebook we used to discuss basic data types in Python is [here](https://github.com/josephofiowa/GA-DSI/blob/master/intro-to-apis-python/code/Intro.ipynb)

### Using Our first API!

The .py file (that we used in Spyder) to make requests and use our very first API (gasp!) is available [here](https://github.com/josephofiowa/dekegeek/blob/master/boshac16/code/api-usage-example.py)
